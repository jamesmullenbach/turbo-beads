turbo-beads
===========

This is a physical simulation of a long string of beads (>1000) falling off a table due to gravity. The purpose of this was to investigate the physical phenomenon demonstrated in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ukMId5fIi0. The lip on the end of the table is there to act as a lip such as that found in the beaker in the video and in real-life experiments. Certain parameters such as friction on the ground, the height of the lip, and the length of the chain can be tweaked in the initialization code.
